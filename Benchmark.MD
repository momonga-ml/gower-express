## Recommendations

### For Users

1. **Small Datasets** (≤1000 samples): Current optimizations provide modest benefits
2. **Large Datasets** (≥10000 samples): Use original implementation until optimization is improved
3. **GPU Acceleration**: Install CuPy if GPU acceleration is needed: `pip install cupy-cuda11x`

### For Developers
